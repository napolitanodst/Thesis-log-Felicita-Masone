# Thesis log
## Heme-Hemopexin
In the Heme-Hemopexin directory you will find three R scripts:
* Analysis - heme 1000
* Baseline method
* spatialDE pipeline - SVG

#### Significant genes

#### Supplementary 

## SpatialLIBD
In the [spatialLIBD](https://github.com/napolitanodst/Thesis-log-Felicita-Masone/tree/main/spatialLIBD) directory you can find my first attempts with spatial transcriptomics data made by following the pipelines of spatialLIBD (R package v1.10.1) and SpatialExperiment (R package v1.8.1) both available on Bioconductor: _[spatialLIBD](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/spatialLIBD.html), [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialExperiment.html)_.

## Wiki
In the [Wiki](https://github.com/napolitanodst/Thesis-log-Felicita-Masone/wiki) section you can find all the updates about how to perform the analyses as well as links to interesting papers and datasets on spatial transcriptomics that I have collected throughout these months.

## Dataset
All data are available on Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number **GSE182127**.
The dataset can also be downloaded from Zenodo at this [link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5638720).
